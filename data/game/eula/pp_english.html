<b>2.	INFORMATION FOR FM DATA SUBJECTS</b><br>

<br>

<b>INFORMATION WE MAY COLLECT FROM YOU</b><br>

<p>FM uses a complex, detailed and accurate database to simulate real-world football performance. The FM database comprises data compiled from and using or representing real-life footballers, managers, referees, team coaching and medical staff (“Data Subjects”) from around the world. The database includes full names of the Data Subjects as well as characteristics, behaviour and likenesses as they relate to the Data Subject’s footballing career in the real world.</p>
<p>Specifically, SEGA collects some or all of the following personal data in respect of each Data Subject:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Given first name and surname;</li>
	<li>Date of birth;</li>
	<li>Age;</li>
	<li>Nationality;</li>
	<li>Head shot photograph;</li>
	<li>Details about the Data Subject’s club, which may include contract type and expiration date, team and game statistics;</li>
	<li>Estimated gross salary, earnings per week and number of bonuses awarded;</li>
	<li>Physical attributes, such as hair colour, height, weight and body type;</li>
	<li>Medical history where Data Subjects have made such medical history public;</li>
	<li>Various technical, mental and physical attributes.</li>
</ul>
<p>(together, the "<b>FM Data</b>").</p>

<b>USES MADE OF FM DATA</b><br>
<p>The FM Data is compiled by SEGA’s scouting network which comprises approximately 1,300 individuals across 50 countries (the "<b>Network</b>"). The Network collects the FM Data in three ways: (i) through attendance at football matches where Data Subject performance is observed and rated; (ii) through publicly available information such as newspapers, match programmes, websites and TV programmes; and (iii) through SEGA’s relationships with various third parties such as football clubs, leagues and football associations.</p>
<p>Once the FM Data has been compiled by the Network, SEGA’s in-house research team review the FM Data and data sources.  Subjective sets of ratings which cover physical, mental and technical attributes of Data Subjects are built up over a period of weeks, months and years to provide a full profile by watching these players play in matches or in training sessions, reading match reports on various types of media, and by referencing SEGA’s forums where discussions are to be found on each set of data within each country. Once the FM Data has been verified and cross-referenced by SEGA’s in-house researchers, it is then integrated within the FM database to provide customers with a rich and realistic football management experience.</p>
<p>Additionally, Data Subjects are rated by the Network in more than 30 categories based on technical ability (for example: dribbling and corner-taking), mental ability (for example: aggression and decision-making) and physical ability (for example: balance and agility). These ratings are intended to reflect the Data Subject’s ability, but SEGA makes no guarantee, warranty or representation as to the accuracy of such ratings at any time.</p>

<b>YOUR RIGHTS</b><br>
<p>Whilst SEGA takes great care to verify the accuracy of the FM Data, and takes stringent security measures to protect such data, Data Subjects have the right to ask us: (i) to amend the FM Data; or (ii) not to process the FM Data within the FM database. You can exercise your right by contacting SEGA at the following email address: notifications@sigames.com</p>
<p>SEGA shall aim to remove or amend the FM Data (as applicable) from the FM database within five (5) working days upon receipt of the Data Subject’s written request.</p>

<b>3.	WHERE WE STORE CUSTOMER PERSONAL DATA AND FM DATA</b><br>
<p>The data that we collect from customers and Data Subjects may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("<b>EEA</b>").

By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. SEGA will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>

<p>We may disclose your personal information to third parties:</p>
<p>In the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, we may disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets.</p>
<p>If SEGA or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, personal data held by it about its customers will be one of the transferred assets.</p>
