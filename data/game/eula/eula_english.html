Additional Definitions.&nbsp;As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.&nbsp;"The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.&nbsp;An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.&nbsp;A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked Version".&nbsp;The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.&nbsp;The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.&nbsp;1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.&nbsp;You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.&nbsp;2. Conveying Modified Versions.&nbsp;If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:&nbsp;a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or&nbsp;b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.&nbsp;3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.&nbsp;The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:&nbsp;a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.&nbsp;b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.&nbsp;4. Combined Works.&nbsp;You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:&nbsp;a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.&nbsp;b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.&nbsp;c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.&nbsp;d) Do one of the following: 0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.&nbsp;1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.&nbsp;e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)&nbsp;5. Combined Libraries.&nbsp;You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:&nbsp;a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.&nbsp;b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.&nbsp;6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.&nbsp;The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.&nbsp;Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.&nbsp;If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.</p>

</p>
<p>
    Introduction
</p>
<p>
    ============
</p>
<p>
    The FreeType Project is distributed in several archive packages;
</p>
<p>
    some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,
</p>
<p>
    various tools and contributions which rely on, or relate to, the
</p>
<p>
    FreeType Project.
</p>
<p>
    This license applies to all files found in such packages, and
</p>
<p>
    which do not fall under their own explicit license. The license
</p>
<p>
    affects thus the FreeType font engine, the test programs,
</p>
<p>
    documentation and makefiles, at the very least.
</p>
<p>
    This license was inspired by the BSD, Artistic, and IJG
</p>
<p>
    (Independent JPEG Group) licenses, which all encourage inclusion
</p>
<p>
    and use of free software in commercial and freeware products
</p>
<p>
    alike. As a consequence, its main points are that:
</p>
<p>
    o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be
</p>
<p>
    interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)
</p>
<p>
    o You can use this software for whatever you want, in parts or
</p>
<p>
    full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)
</p>
<p>
    o You may not pretend that you wrote this software. If you use
</p>
<p>
    it, or only parts of it, in a program, you must acknowledge
</p>
<p>
    somewhere in your documentation that you have used the
</p>
<p>
    FreeType code. (`credits')
</p>
<p>
    We specifically permit and encourage the inclusion of this
</p>
<p>
    software, with or without modifications, in commercial products.
</p>
<p>
    We disclaim all warranties covering The FreeType Project and
</p>
<p>
    assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, many people asked us for a preferred form for a
</p>
<p>
    credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license. We thus
</p>
<p>
    encourage you to use the following text:
</p>
<p>
    """

<p>

</p>
<p>
    Please replace &lt;year&gt; with the value from the FreeType version you
</p>
<p>
    actually use.

    ===========
</p>
<p>
    0. Definitions
</p>
<p>
    --------------
</p>
<p>
    Throughout this license, the terms `package', `FreeType Project',
</p>
<p>
    and `FreeType archive' refer to the set of files originally
</p>
<p>
    distributed by the authors (David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and
</p>
<p>
    Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,
</p>
<p>
    beta or final release.
</p>
<p>
    `You' refers to the licensee, or person using the project, where
</p>
<p>
    `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source
</p>
<p>
    code as well as linking it to form a `program' or `executable'.
</p>
<p>
    This program is referred to as `a program using the FreeType
</p>
<p>
    engine'.
</p>
<p>
    This license applies to all files distributed in the original
</p>
<p>
    FreeType Project, including all source code, binaries and
</p>
<p>
    documentation, unless otherwise stated in the file in its
</p>
<p>
    original, unmodified form as distributed in the original archive.
</p>
<p>
    If you are unsure whether or not a particular file is covered by
</p>
<p>
    this license, you must contact us to verify this.
</p>
<p>
    The FreeType Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000 by David Turner,
</p>
<p>
    Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg. All rights reserved except as
</p>
<p>
    specified below.
</p>
<p>
    1. No Warranty
</p>
<p>
    --------------
</p>
<p>
    THE FREETYPE PROJECT IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
</p>
<p>
    KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
</p>
<p>
    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
</p>
<p>
    PURPOSE. IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
</p>
<p>
    BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED BY THE USE OR THE INABILITY TO
</p>
<p>
    USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.
</p>
<p>
    2. Redistribution
</p>
<p>
    -----------------
</p>
<p>
    This license grants a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual and
</p>
<p>
    irrevocable right and license to use, execute, perform, compile,
</p>
<p>
    display, copy, create derivative works of, distribute and
</p>
<p>
    sublicense the FreeType Project (in both source and object code
</p>
<p>
    forms) and derivative works thereof for any purpose; and to
</p>
<p>
    authorize others to exercise some or all of the rights granted
</p>
<p>
    herein, subject to the following conditions:
</p>
<p>
    o Redistribution of source code must retain this license file
</p>
<p>
    (`FTL.TXT') unaltered; any additions, deletions or changes to
</p>
<p>
    the original files must be clearly indicated in accompanying
</p>
<p>
    documentation. The copyright notices of the unaltered,
</p>
<p>
    original files must be preserved in all copies of source
</p>
<p>
    files.
</p>
<p>
    o Redistribution in binary form must provide a disclaimer that
</p>
<p>
    states that the software is based in part of the work of the
</p>
<p>
    FreeType Team, in the distribution documentation. We also
</p>
<p>
    encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page in your
</p>
<p>
    documentation, though this isn't mandatory.
</p>
<p>
    These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on
</p>
<p>
    the FreeType Project, not just the unmodified files. If you use
</p>
<p>
    our work, you must acknowledge us. However, no fee need be paid
</p>
<p>
    to us.
</p>
<p>
    3. Advertising
</p>
<p>
    --------------
</p>
<p>
    Neither the FreeType authors and contributors nor you shall use
</p>
<p>
    the name of the other for commercial, advertising, or promotional
</p>
<p>
    purposes without specific prior written permission.
</p>
<p>
    We suggest, but do not require, that you use one or more of the
</p>
<p>
    following phrases to refer to this software in your documentation
</p>
<p>
    or advertising materials: `FreeType Project', `FreeType Engine',
</p>
<p>
    `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.
</p>
<p>
    As you have not signed this license, you are not required to
</p>
<p>
    accept it. However, as the FreeType Project is copyrighted
</p>
<p>
    material, only this license, or another one contracted with the
</p>
<p>
    authors, grants you the right to use, distribute, and modify it.
</p>
<p>
    Therefore, by using, distributing, or modifying the FreeType
</p>
<p>
    Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms
</p>
<p>
    of this license.
</p>
<p>

<p>
    PREAMBLE
</p>
<p>
    The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
    development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
    efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
    open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
    with others.
</p>
<p>
    The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
    redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The fonts,
    including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, redistributed
    and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved names are not used
    by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released
    under any other type of license. The requirement for fonts to remain under
    this license does not apply to any document created using the fonts or
    their derivatives.
</p>
<p>
    DEFINITIONS

<p>A large portion of the dictionary entries originate from ICOT Free Software.  The following conditions for ICOT Free Software applies to the current dictionary as well.</p>

<p>Each User may also freely distribute the Program, whether in its original form or modified, to any third party or parties, PROVIDED that the provisions of Section 3 ("NO WARRANTY") will ALWAYS appear on, or be attached to, the Program, which is distributed substantially in the same form as set out herein and that such intended distribution, if actually made, will neither violate or otherwise contravene any of the laws and regulations of the countries having jurisdiction over the User or the intended distribution itself.</p>
<p>        </p>
<p>NO WARRANTY</p>
<p>        </p>
<p>The program was produced on an experimental basis in the course of the research and development conducted during the project and is provided to users as so produced on an experimental basis.  Accordingly, the</p>
<p>program is provided without any warranty whatsoever, whether express,</p>
<p>implied, statutory or otherwise.  The term "warranty" used herein</p>
<p>includes, but is not limited to, any warranty of the quality, performance, merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose of</p>
<p>the program and the nonexistence of any infringement or violation of</p>
<p>any right of any third party.</p>
<p>        </p>
<p>Each user of the program will agree and understand, and be deemed to</p>
<p>have agreed and understood, that there is no warranty whatsoever for</p>
<p>the program and, accordingly, the entire risk arising from or</p>
<p>otherwise connected with the program is assumed by the user.</p>

<p>Therefore, neither ICOT, the copyright holder, or any other organization that participated in or was otherwise related to the</p>
<p>development of the program and their respective officials, directors,</p>
<p>officers and other employees shall be held liable for any and all</p>
<p>damages, including, without limitation, general, special, incidental</p>
<p>and consequential damages, arising out of or otherwise in connection</p>
<p>with the use or inability to use the program or any product, material</p>
<p>or result produced or otherwise obtained by using the program,</p>
<p>regardless of whether they have been advised of, or otherwise had</p>
<p>knowledge of, the possibility of such damages at any time during the</p>
<p>project or thereafter.  Each user will be deemed to have agreed to the</p>
<p>foregoing by his or her commencement of use of the program.  The term</p>
<p>"use" as used herein includes, but is not limited to, the use,</p>
<p>modification, copying and distribution of the program and the</p>
<p>production of secondary products from the program.</p>
<p>        </p>
<p>In the case where the program, whether in its original form or</p>
<p>modified, was distributed or delivered to or received by a user from</p>
<p>any person, organization or entity other than ICOT, unless it makes or</p>
<p>grants independently of ICOT any specific warranty to the user in</p>
<p>writing, such person, organization or entity, will also be exempted</p>
<p>from and not be held liable to the user for any such damages as noted</p>
<p>above as far as the program is concerned.</p>

    5. Time Zone Database
</h3>
<p>
ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from    <a href="http://www.iana.org/time-zones">Time Zone Database</a> for its
    time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database is explained in
    <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6557">
        BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone Database
    </a>
    section 7.
</p>
<p>7.  Database Ownership</p>

<p>The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF</p>
<p>document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work</p>
<p>that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the public</p>
<p>domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do not apply</p>
<p>to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make to it.</p>
<p>Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ Database,</p>
<p>the organization that is providing the IANA Considerations defined in</p>
<p>this RFC, under the memorandum of understanding with the IETF,</p>
<p>currently ICANN, may act in accordance with all competent court</p>
<p>orders.  No ownership claims will be made by ICANN or the IETF Trust</p>
<p>on the database or the code.  Any person making a contribution to the</p>
<p>database or code waives all rights to future claims in that</p>
<p>contribution or in the TZ Database.</p>

<p>GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</p>

<p>Version 3, 29 June 2007</p>

<p>Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <a href="http://fsf.org/">http://fsf.org/</a></p>

<p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>

<p>This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.</p>

<p>0. Additional Definitions.</p>

<p>As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.</p>

<p>"The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.</p>

<p>An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.</p>

<p>A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked Version".</p>

<p>The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.</p>

<p>The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.</p>

<p>1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.</p>

<p>You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.</p>

<p>2. Conveying Modified Versions.</p>

<p>If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:</p>

<p>a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or</p>

<p>b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.</p>

<p>3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.</p>

<p>The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:</p>

<p>a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.</p>

<p>b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.</p>

<p>4. Combined Works.</p>

<p>You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:</p>

<p>a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.</p>

<p>b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.</p>

<p>c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.</p>

<p>d) Do one of the following: </p>

<p>0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.</p>

<p>1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.</p>

<p>e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)</p>

<p>5. Combined Libraries.</p>

<p>You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:</p>

<p>a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based  on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.</p>

<p>b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</p>

<p>6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.</p>

<p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</p>

<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.</p>

<p>If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.</p>

</p>
<p>
    This Product may include the option to purchase virtual, in-game currency
    ("<strong>Virtual Currency</strong>"). The Product may also include
    virtual, in-game digital items and/or other virtual, in-game goods and
    services (collectively, "<strong>Virtual Goods</strong>"). Virtual Currency
    and Virtual Goods may be obtained from SEGA and/or third parties as
    follows: (i) obtained through gameplay within the Product, (ii) purchased
    from SEGA in exchange for "real world" money if you are a legal adult in
    your country of residence, (iii) Virtual Goods may be purchased using
    Virtual Currency in some circumstances, (iv) purchased from third parties,
    such as operators of mobile games platform stores (such as Google Play for
    Android devices and Apple iTunes Appstore for iOs devices) in exchange for
    "real world" money if you are a legal adult in your country of residence,
    (v) obtained by exchanging credits or other virtual items from the third
    party websites, so long as such an exchange is permitted by the applicable
    third party website and SEGA, or (vi) obtained through interaction or
participation with certain third-party advertisements and services (the “    <strong>Virtual Currency Acquisition Methods</strong>”).
</p>
<p>
    In the event you choose to purchase Virtual Currency or Virtual Goods from
    SEGA or its affiliates, you agree to the pricing, payment and billing
    policies applicable to such fees and charges, as notified to you at the
    time of purchase. All fees are non-refundable and non-transferable except
    as expressly provided in these Terms. All fees and applicable taxes, if
    any, are payable in local currency unless specified otherwise at the time
    of purchase. SEGA has no control over how third parties operate a system of
    credits or Virtual Goods and whether or not such credits or Virtual Goods
    can be exchanged with the Virtual Currency, so this method of obtaining
    Virtual Currency may not always be available to you. In addition, Sega has
    no control over the pricing, payment and billing policies applicable to
    such purchases.
</p>
<p>
    Virtual Goods and Virtual Currency are digital items only with no
    cash-value. Virtual Currency and Virtual Goods may never be redeemed with
    "real world" money, goods or other items of monetary value from SEGA or any
    other party. Your right to use any Virtual Goods and Virtual Currency that
    you obtain are limited to a non-exclusive, non-transferable,
    non-sublicenseable, revocable right to use such Virtual Goods and Virtual
    Currency solely for your personal entertainment and non-commercial use and
    for no other purpose. Except for the limited rights described herein, you
    have no property interest or right or title in or to any such Virtual Goods
    or Virtual Currency, which remain the exclusive property of SEGA.
</p>
<p>
    Except where explicitly authorised by SEGA, (i) transfers of Virtual
    Currency or Virtual Goods are strictly prohibited; (ii) you may not buy or
    sell any Virtual Currency or Virtual Goods for "real world" money or
    otherwise exchange items for value; and (iii) SEGA does not recognise any
    such purported transfers of Virtual Currency or Virtual Goods, nor the
    purported sale, gift or trade in the "real world" of anything that appears
    in the Product. Any attempt to do any of the foregoing is in violation of
    the terms of this Agreement will result in an automatic termination of your
    rights to use the Virtual Currency or Virtual Goods and may result in
    termination of your Account, a lifetime ban from the Product and SEGA’s
    other products and services and/or possible legal action. You agree that
    all sales of Virtual Goods and Virtual Currency are final. No refunds will
    be given, except in SEGA's sole and absolute discretion.
</p>
<p>
    As stated above, the existence of a particular offer of Virtual Goods or
    Virtual Currency is not a commitment by SEGA to maintain or continue to
    make the Virtual Goods or Virtual Currency available in the future. The
    scope, variety and type of Virtual Goods and Virtual Currency that you may
    obtain can change at any time. SEGA has the absolute right to manage,
    regulate, control, modify or eliminate such Virtual Currency or Virtual
    Goods as it sees fit in its sole discretion, and SEGA will have no
    liability to you or anyone for the exercise of such rights.
