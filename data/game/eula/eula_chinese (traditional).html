<pre>GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>Version 3, 29 June 2007</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;</pre>
<pre>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>0.Additional Definitions.</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>"The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library.The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked Version".</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>1.Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>2.Conveying Modified Versions.</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>3.Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library.You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>4.Combined Works.</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>d) Do one of the following: </pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library.A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version.(If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code.If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>5.Combined Libraries.</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based  on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>6.Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time.Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.</pre>

</p>
<p>
    Introduction
</p>
<p>
    ============
</p>
<p>
    The FreeType Project is distributed in several archive packages;
</p>
<p>
    some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,
</p>
<p>
    various tools and contributions which rely on, or relate to, the
</p>
<p>
    FreeType Project.
</p>
<p>
    This license applies to all files found in such packages, and
</p>
<p>
    which do not fall under their own explicit license.The license
</p>
<p>
    affects thus the FreeType font engine, the test programs,
</p>
<p>
    documentation and makefiles, at the very least.
</p>
<p>
    This license was inspired by the BSD, Artistic, and IJG
</p>
<p>
    (Independent JPEG Group) licenses, which all encourage inclusion
</p>
<p>
    and use of free software in commercial and freeware products
</p>
<p>
    alike.As a consequence, its main points are that:
</p>
<p>
    o We don't promise that this software works.However, we will be
</p>
<p>
    interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)
</p>
<p>
    o You can use this software for whatever you want, in parts or
</p>
<p>
    full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)
</p>
<p>
    o You may not pretend that you wrote this software.If you use
</p>
<p>
    it, or only parts of it, in a program, you must acknowledge
</p>
<p>
    somewhere in your documentation that you have used the
</p>
<p>
    FreeType code. (`credits')
</p>
<p>
    We specifically permit and encourage the inclusion of this
</p>
<p>
    software, with or without modifications, in commercial products.
</p>
<p>
    We disclaim all warranties covering The FreeType Project and
</p>
<p>
    assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, many people asked us for a preferred form for a
</p>
<p>
    credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.We thus
</p>
<p>
    encourage you to use the following text:
</p>
<p>
    """
</p>

</p>
<p>
    """
</p>
<p>
    Please replace &lt;year&gt; with the value from the FreeType version you
</p>
<p>
    actually use.

    Legal Terms
</p>
<p>
    ===========
</p>
<p>
    0.Definitions
</p>
<p>
    --------------
</p>
<p>
    Throughout this license, the terms `package', `FreeType Project',
</p>
<p>
    and `FreeType archive' refer to the set of files originally
</p>
<p>
    distributed by the authors (David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and
</p>
<p>
    Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,
</p>
<p>
    beta or final release.
</p>
<p>
    `You' refers to the licensee, or person using the project, where
</p>
<p>
    `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source
</p>
<p>
    code as well as linking it to form a `program' or `executable'.
</p>
<p>
    This program is referred to as `a program using the FreeType
</p>
<p>
    engine'.
</p>
<p>
    This license applies to all files distributed in the original
</p>
<p>
    FreeType Project, including all source code, binaries and
</p>
<p>
    documentation, unless otherwise stated in the file in its
</p>
<p>
    original, unmodified form as distributed in the original archive.
</p>
<p>
    If you are unsure whether or not a particular file is covered by
</p>
<p>
    this license, you must contact us to verify this.
</p>
<p>
    The FreeType Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000 by David Turner,
</p>
<p>
    Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.All rights reserved except as
</p>
<p>
    specified below.
</p>
<p>
    1.No Warranty
</p>
<p>
    --------------
</p>
<p>
    THE FREETYPE PROJECT IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
</p>
<p>
    KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
</p>
<p>
    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
</p>
<p>
    PURPOSE.IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
</p>
<p>
    BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED BY THE USE OR THE INABILITY TO
</p>
<p>
    USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.
</p>
<p>
    2.Redistribution
</p>
<p>
    -----------------
</p>
<p>
    This license grants a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual and
</p>
<p>
    irrevocable right and license to use, execute, perform, compile,
</p>
<p>
    display, copy, create derivative works of, distribute and
</p>
<p>
    sublicense the FreeType Project (in both source and object code
</p>
<p>
    forms) and derivative works thereof for any purpose; and to
</p>
<p>
    authorize others to exercise some or all of the rights granted
</p>
<p>
    herein, subject to the following conditions:
</p>
<p>
    o Redistribution of source code must retain this license file
</p>
<p>
    (`FTL.TXT') unaltered; any additions, deletions or changes to
</p>
<p>
    the original files must be clearly indicated in accompanying
</p>
<p>
    documentation. The copyright notices of the unaltered,
</p>
<p>
    original files must be preserved in all copies of source
</p>
<p>
    files.
</p>
<p>
    o Redistribution in binary form must provide a disclaimer that
</p>
<p>
    states that the software is based in part of the work of the
</p>
<p>
    FreeType Team, in the distribution documentation.We also
</p>
<p>
    encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page in your
</p>
<p>
    documentation, though this isn't mandatory.
</p>
<p>
    These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on
</p>
<p>
    the FreeType Project, not just the unmodified files. If you use
</p>
<p>
    our work, you must acknowledge us.However, no fee need be paid
</p>
<p>
    to us.
</p>
<p>
    3.Advertising
</p>
<p>
    --------------
</p>
<p>
    Neither the FreeType authors and contributors nor you shall use
</p>
<p>
    the name of the other for commercial, advertising, or promotional
</p>
<p>
    purposes without specific prior written permission.
</p>
<p>
    We suggest, but do not require, that you use one or more of the
</p>
<p>
    following phrases to refer to this software in your documentation
</p>
<p>
    or advertising materials: `FreeType Project', `FreeType Engine',
</p>
<p>
    `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.
</p>
<p>
    As you have not signed this license, you are not required to
</p>
<p>
    accept it. However, as the FreeType Project is copyrighted
</p>
<p>
    material, only this license, or another one contracted with the
</p>
<p>
    authors, grants you the right to use, distribute, and modify it.
</p>
<p>
    Therefore, by using, distributing, or modifying the FreeType
</p>
<p>
    Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms
</p>
<p>
    of this license.
</p>
<p>
    4.Contacts
</p>
<p>
    -----------

    PREAMBLE
</p>
<p>

    and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved names are not used
    by derivative works.The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released
    under any other type of license.The requirement for fonts to remain under

<pre>A large portion of the dictionary entries originate from ICOT Free Software.The following conditions for ICOT Free Software applies to the current dictionary as well.</pre>
<pre> </pre>
<pre>Each User may also freely distribute the Program, whether in its original form or modified, to any third party or parties, PROVIDED that the provisions of Section 3 ("NO WARRANTY") will ALWAYS appear on, or be attached to, the Program, which is distributed substantially in the same form as set out herein and that such intended distribution, if actually made, will neither violate or otherwise contravene any of the laws and regulations of the countries having jurisdiction over the User or the intended distribution itself.</pre>
<pre>        </pre>
<pre>NO WARRANTY</pre>
<pre>        </pre>
<pre>The program was produced on an experimental basis in the course of the research and development conducted during the project and is provided to users as so produced on an experimental basis.Accordingly, the</pre>
<pre>program is provided without any warranty whatsoever, whether express,</pre>
<pre>implied, statutory or otherwise.The term "warranty" used herein</pre>
<pre>includes, but is not limited to, any warranty of the quality, performance, merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose of</pre>
<pre>the program and the nonexistence of any infringement or violation of</pre>
<pre>any right of any third party.</pre>
<pre>        </pre>
<pre>Each user of the program will agree and understand, and be deemed to</pre>
<pre>have agreed and understood, that there is no warranty whatsoever for</pre>
<pre>the program and, accordingly, the entire risk arising from or</pre>
<pre>otherwise connected with the program is assumed by the user.</pre>
<pre> </pre>
<pre>Therefore, neither ICOT, the copyright holder, or any other organization that participated in or was otherwise related to the</pre>
<pre>development of the program and their respective officials, directors,</pre>
<pre>officers and other employees shall be held liable for any and all</pre>
<pre>damages, including, without limitation, general, special, incidental</pre>
<pre>and consequential damages, arising out of or otherwise in connection</pre>
<pre>with the use or inability to use the program or any product, material</pre>
<pre>or result produced or otherwise obtained by using the program,</pre>
<pre>regardless of whether they have been advised of, or otherwise had</pre>
<pre>knowledge of, the possibility of such damages at any time during the</pre>
<pre>project or thereafter.Each user will be deemed to have agreed to the</pre>
<pre>foregoing by his or her commencement of use of the program.The term</pre>
<pre>"use" as used herein includes, but is not limited to, the use,</pre>
<pre>modification, copying and distribution of the program and the</pre>
<pre>production of secondary products from the program.</pre>
<pre>        </pre>
<pre>In the case where the program, whether in its original form or</pre>

<pre>grants independently of ICOT any specific warranty to the user in</pre>

    5.Time Zone Database
</h3>
<p>
ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from    <a href="http://www.iana.org/time-zones">Time Zone Database</a> for its
    time zone support.The ownership of the TZ database is explained in
    <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6557">
        BCP 175:Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone Database
    </a>
    section 7.
</p>
<pre>7.Database Ownership</pre>
<pre> </pre>
<pre>The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF</pre>
<pre>document.Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work</pre>
<pre>that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the public</pre>
<pre>domain.Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do not apply</pre>
<pre>to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make to it.</pre>
<pre>Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ Database,</pre>
<pre>the organization that is providing the IANA Considerations defined in</pre>
<pre>this RFC, under the memorandum of understanding with the IETF,</pre>
<pre>currently ICANN, may act in accordance with all competent court</pre>
<pre>orders.No ownership claims will be made by ICANN or the IETF Trust</pre>
<pre>on the database or the code.Any person making a contribution to the</pre>
<pre>database or code waives all rights to future claims in that</pre>
<pre>contribution or in the TZ Database.</pre>

<pre>GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>Version 3, 29 June 2007</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <a href="http://fsf.org/">http://fsf.org/</a></pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>0.Additional Definitions.</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>"The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library.The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked Version".</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>1.Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>2.Conveying Modified Versions.</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>3.Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library.You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>4.Combined Works.</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>d) Do one of the following: </pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library.A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version.(If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code.If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>5.Combined Libraries.</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based  on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>6.Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time.Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.</pre>

    本產品可能會包含購買虛擬的遊戲內貨幣（「<strong>虛擬貨幣</strong>
    」）的選項。產品亦可能包含虛擬的遊戲內數碼物品和/或其他虛擬遊戲內商品和服務（統稱「<strong>虛擬商品</strong>
    」）。虛擬貨幣和虛擬商品可能透過以下方式從世嘉和/或第三方取得：(i) 遊玩產品取得，(ii)
    如閣下在居住國家或地區為法定成年人，使用「現實」貨幣從世嘉購買，(iii) 在某些情況下使用虛擬貨幣購買虛擬商品，(iv)
    如閣下在居住國家或地區為法定成年人，使用「現實」貨幣從第三方，例如流動遊戲平台商店（如 Android 裝置的 Google Play 或 iOS
    裝置的 Apple iTunes）購買，(v) 在第三方或世嘉許可下，從第三方的網站兌換點數或其他虛擬物品，或 (vi)
    透過與某些第三方廣告或服務互動（<strong>「虛擬貨幣取得方式」</strong>）。
</p>
<p>
    閣下選擇從世嘉或其相關連方購買虛擬貨幣或虛擬商品代表閣下同意接受在購買時告知閣下的訂價、付款及適用於此收費的政策。除本條款內明文註明的情況之外，所有費用不可退回亦不可轉讓。除非在購買時另行註明，否則一切費用及任何適用稅項皆以當地貨幣支付。世嘉無法控制第三方如何營運點數或虛擬商品系統，以及此點數或虛擬商品是否能以虛擬貨幣兌換，因此這個取得虛擬貨幣的方式未必適用於閣下。除此之外，世嘉無法控制這些購買的訂價、付款及收費政策。
</p>
<p>
    虛擬商品及虛擬貨幣僅為數碼物品，並無現金價值。虛擬貨幣和虛擬商品永不可以從世嘉或任何其他方使用「現實世界」金錢、商品或其他具有金錢價值的物品兌換。閣下使用任何取得的虛擬商品和虛擬貨幣的權利僅限於作為個人娛樂及非商業性使用（不得用於任何其他目的）的非獨有、不可轉讓、不可再授權並可撤銷的權利。除本文內明文描述的權利外，任何此類虛擬商品或虛擬貨幣仍為世嘉的獨有財產，閣下對其不具任何財產權益或權利或所有權。
</p>
<p>
    除世嘉明確授權情況以外，(i) 禁止轉讓虛擬貨幣或虛擬商品；(ii)
    不得以「現實」金錢購買或售賣任何虛擬貨幣或虛擬商品，亦不得以其他方式交易具價值的物品，而 (iii)
    世嘉不承認對虛擬貨幣或虛擬商品轉讓的聲稱，亦不承認任何對產品內的任何事物在「現實世界」進行買賣、饋贈或交易的聲稱。嘗試進行上述任何行為皆違反本協議條款，會自動終止閣下使用虛擬貨幣或虛擬商品的權利，並可能導致閣下的帳戶受到停止，永久禁止閣下使用產品和世嘉的其他產品和服務及/或對閣下採取可能的法律行動。閣下同意所有虛擬商品及虛擬貨幣銷售皆為最終的。除世嘉全權及絕對酌情決定外，不作任何退款。
</p>
<p>
    如上所述，提供特定的虛擬商品或虛擬貨幣不代表世嘉承諾維持或繼續保證該虛擬商品或虛擬貨幣在未來仍可繼續使用。閣下可能取得的虛擬商品和虛擬貨幣的範圍、多樣性和類型可能在任何時候改變。世嘉有絕對全權酌情決定權利管理、規管、控制、修改或消除該虛擬貨幣或虛擬商品，而世嘉在履行該權利時對閣下或任何人概不負責。

    本協議代表閣下與世嘉對於產品的完整協議，並取代所有閣下之前與世嘉關於同一標的事項的協議和陳述、保證或諒解（無論疏忽或不知情下作成，但不包括欺詐性的）。世嘉保留權利隨時全權以任何方式修正或修改此協議，而不需負任何責任。
</p>
<p>
    如協議的任何部分在適用法規下被裁定為無效或不可強制執行，包括但不限於上述的保證、卸責聲明和限制責任，無效或無法不可執行的條文將最由接近原條文意圖的有效及可予強制執行條文所取代，協議剩餘部分仍然有效。我們未能強制執行或履行協議的任何條文或相關權利並不構成放棄該權利或條文。
</p>
<p>
    世嘉可以於任何時候轉讓本協議的整體或部分。即使如此，閣下未經世嘉事前明文書面許可不得分配、轉讓或再授權閣下在本授權下的任何或全部權利或義務。
