Some features of the Services may still be available to you if you decide not to register for an account, as explained in Section 5 below.

You will immediately notify SEGA of any unauthorised use of your Account. 
1.3 	You should create your Account with a strong password, which is different from any password you use for your other online services. The system may remember your sign-in information depending on your browser and in-game client settings and whether you select the option to store these settings, which means that you will be automatically signed into your Account for some or all of the Services which are available to you. Your password may be reset at any time by clicking on the "Forgotten Password" button on the login screen. The password will be sent to the email address registered with your Account. You are responsible for safeguarding your password.

1.6	You may register for multiple Accounts provided that you register a different email address for each Account.
